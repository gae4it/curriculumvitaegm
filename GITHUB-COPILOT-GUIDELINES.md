# GITHUB COPILOT GUIDELINES

These are the guidelines that GitHub Copilot (AI assistant) must follow for this project:

1. **Language**: All code, comments, documentation, and commit messages must be written exclusively in English.
2. **Documentation**: Always keep documentation up to date and clear. Use concise, professional English.
3. **Personal Data**: Never expose or move personal data outside of the main home page (`index.astro`).
4. **SEO & Privacy**: Do not add any SEO or tracking features. The site must be fully blocked from search engine and AI bot indexing (robots.txt, meta tags, headers).
5. **Single Page Structure**: All main content must reside in a single page (`index.astro`). No external content or template files for the CV.
6. **Component Reference**: Collect all reusable demo components in `components.astro` for reference and reuse.
7. **TypeScript**: Place all custom type declarations in `src/types.d.ts`.
8. **Design**: Follow the design and structure as described in PLAN.md (timeline, cards, sliders, emoji, etc.).
9. **No Redundant Files**: Remove or avoid unnecessary demo, markdown, or template files.
10. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent code style, naming, and formatting throughout the project.

> These guidelines must be respected for all future work in this repository.
